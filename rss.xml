            <title><![CDATA[World Changers and Rule Breakers]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I recently received an invitation to attend what I am hoping to be a life changing event later this month. I will be joining 29 other innovators and creators from around the world on Necker Island (yes, Richard Branson's private island). I am looking at this adventure as an opportunity to break down some of my personal barriers so that I can begin to visualize my next steps. I really need to just get out of my own way. My plan is that by removing myself from my normal day-to-day locale, and by surrounding myself with like-minded people looking to do big things, that I will be able to get there. </p>]]></description>
