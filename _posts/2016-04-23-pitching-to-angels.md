I have the pleasure of being an angel investor with Sand Hill Angels and one of the events that we do every month involves having founders come and present their pitches while we provide feedback on how to make the five-minute pitches more effective. To say this is fun is an understatement but it is also frustrating in that many founders fail to provide the basic information that I, as an investor, am looking for.

Even in a quick pitch, there is time to cover the fundamental areas. If these are not included in the presentation, founders need to be prepared to answer during Q&A although it is much better to provide the basic information during the pitch to demonstrate a certain level of proficiency.

1. Define the product succinctly and what problem you are trying to solve with it. I also need to know whether it is still conceptual, is in prototype, or is on the market and if you have any protectable IP. Most importantly, don't get too technical or go into too many details...analogies are good if the product is complex or new.
2. Management team. Why should I have faith that your team can execute on the concept? Convince me that I can trust you to do amazing things with my money.
3. Market size. What are the market and revenue opportunities and how are you planning on accessing that market? Be realistic here. The fastest way to lose credibility is to say that you are going to access 100% of a huge market.
4. Show me that you know your market space and that you've done your homework and how you are better or different from the competition.
5. Revenue Model. Define what your plan is for generating revenue whether it is subscription based, licensing, services, direct to customer sale, through a distributor, or some other mechanism. I need to know that you have thought through your pricing and distribution model.
6. What are you asking for, what are your terms, and how will you use the investment to further the business?

The order in which this information is presented is less important than making sure you grab our attention and keep it. The point of the pitch is to whet our appetite so we ask for more information as it is the beginning of the conversation with investors.

During the Q&A, keep the answers short and to the point so you have time to answer many questions. Answer them confidently as this is your opportunity to demonstrate that you know your business, your product, your market, and you are capable of handling anything that comes your way so that we can trust you with our investment.
