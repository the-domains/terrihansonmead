I recently received an invitation to attend what I am hoping to be a life changing event later this month. I will be joining 29 other innovators and creators from around the world on Necker Island (yes, Richard Branson's private island). I am looking at this adventure as an opportunity to break down some of my personal barriers so that I can begin to visualize my next steps. I really need to just get out of my own way. My plan is that by removing myself from my normal day-to-day locale, and by surrounding myself with like-minded people looking to do big things, that I will be able to get there. 

The program is World Changers and Rule Breakers. 

I also need to bring a $3,000 charitable donate for Virgin Unite and have started a gofundme page to collect from my community. This way my community comes with me and can participate in what I hope to be a life changing event...in a positive way of course. 

Be a part of my community. https://www.gofundme.com/2b2h49cc
