<p> I first heard about the concept of a personal board of directors in a podcast and thought it was brilliant. This goes beyond simply finding mentors and coaches and broadens in scope to covering multiple facets of your career and professional development. <br>The purpose of a board of directors in an organization is to oversee the activities of the business. The same should hold true for your own personal board of directors; they should oversee your professional development. <br>By assembling a board of directors, this means you have given yourself the gift of a team of people to reach out to when there are opportunities, or problems, in order to get multiple perspectives, or have a deep bench of resources to get support or advocacy. Your board of directors should actively advocate for you. <br>Which leads to another podcast I listened to that offered up the idea of a ‘sponsor’ instead of a mentor. If you aren’t quite ready for a board of directors but want some career advice and/or advice on professional direction, a sponsor may be what you need. A sponsor actively advocates for you rather than only being there to provide coaching and guidance. <br>This isn’t to say that having a mentor isn’t going to be beneficial. I didn’t have one and would have loved to have had one as I moved through my career. But now that I have heard about sponsors and a personal board of directors, I plan to be a sponsor to women I can stand behind, and recruit my own board of directors. </p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="15"><!-- react-empty: 16 --></div></section><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 color-title title-size-medium  color-bg text-align-left  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="17"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-2 " data-reactid="18"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px max-w-768px p-1" data-reactid="19"><!-- react-empty: 20 --><!-- react-empty: 21 --><!-- react-empty: 22 --><!-- react-empty: 23 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="24"><p>I have the pleasure of being an angel investor with Sand Hill Angels and one of the events that we do every month involves having founders come and present their pitches while we provide feedback on how to make the five-minute pitches more effective.
