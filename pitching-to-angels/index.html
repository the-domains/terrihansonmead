<p>I have the pleasure of being an angel investor with Sand Hill Angels and one of the events that we do every month involves having founders come and present their pitches while we provide feedback on how to make the five-minute pitches more effective. To say this is fun is an understatement but it is also frustrating in that many founders fail to provide the basic information that I, as an investor, am looking for.</p><p>Even in a quick pitch, there is time to cover the fundamental areas. If these are not included in the presentation, founders need to be prepared to answer during Q&A although it is much better to provide the basic information during the pitch to demonstrate a certain level of proficiency.</p><ol><li>Define the product succinctly and what problem you are trying to solve with it. I also need to know whether it is still conceptual, is in prototype, or is on the market and if you have any protectable IP. Most importantly, don’t get too technical or go into too many details…analogies are good if the product is complex or new.</li><li>Management team.
